# Ideas to plot

Maps

* Heat map (will just be population map probably) 
* Drunk driving incidents in state / tot in state 
* Drunk driving % by month (does it peak around holidays?)
* Most dangerous driving days of the year

Person Data:
Age (possible to compare to age distribution of state?)
Compare types of restraints and injury severity
Drinking vs. Age
Drugs vs. age
Underage drunks
Drugs by state
Breakdowns of cyclist info
Lag time from crash to death
How often are they at work
* Is there something interesting here when combined with time of day?
LOCATION for where non-motorists were during time of crash
Survival by seat
Number of people per car
number of people per accident
AVG number of people in car depending on age

Can I plot position in the car by making factors for row and left, middle, right and
adding jitter and alpha to understand where people sit?

color for survived vs no plot lag time
