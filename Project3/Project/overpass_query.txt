I aquired my map data by going to http://overpass-api.de/query_form.html and using the query form.

I entered the following call:
(node(39.3587, -84.8419, 39.6961, -84.2033);<;);out meta;

This is the area around Oxford, Oh where I graduated from Miami University, plus enough additional
area to get me up above the required 50mb file size (60.6MB).
